##  System Architecture

### Core Components

**1. Data Structure**
```c
typedef struct {
    int slot;              // Slot number (1 to n)
    char vehicleNo[20];    // Vehicle registration
    char ticketID[20];     // Unique ticket identifier
    char type[10];         // Vehicle type: bike/car/truck
    int isVIP;             // VIP status flag
    time_t entryTime;      // Entry timestamp
    int occupied;          // Occupancy status
} Parking;
```

**2. Main Functions**
- `isAlreadyParked()` - Duplicate vehicle detection
- `generateTicketID()` - Unique ticket creation
- `logToFile()` - Transaction recording
- `getRate()` - Rate calculation by vehicle type
- `isValidType()` - Input validation
- `showParkingStatus()` - Display system analytics
- `showParkingMap()` - Visual slot representation
- `parkVehicle()` - Vehicle check-in
- `removeVehicle()` - Vehicle check-out with billing
- `main()` - Menu loop and orchestration

##  Usage Guide

### Main Menu
```
1. Park Vehicle      - Add a vehicle to the parking system
2. Remove Vehicle    - Calculate bill and remove vehicle
3. Display Status    - Show parking analytics
4. Parking Map       - View visual slot layout
5. Exit              - Exit the program
```

### Parking a Vehicle

1. Select option 1 from menu
2. Enter vehicle registration number (e.g., DL01AB1234)
3. Enter vehicle type: **bike**, **car**, or **truck**
4. Specify VIP status (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
5. System assigns the first available slot
6. Unique ticket ID is generated and displayed

### Removing a Vehicle

1. Select option 2 from menu
2. Enter ticket ID (provided during parking)
3. System calculates parking duration
4. Billing breakdown is displayed
5. Option to apply **SAVE10** coupon (case-insensitive)
6. Final bill is calculated and added to revenue
7. Transaction is logged to `parking_log.txt`

##  Billing System

### Rate Structure
- **Bike**: Rs 2 per billing unit
- **Car**: Rs 3 per billing unit
- **Truck**: Rs 5 per billing unit
- **1 Billing Unit** = 10 seconds of parking (minimum 1 unit)

### Billing Calculation Formula

```
Duration (seconds) = Exit Time - Entry Time
Billing Units = Duration / 10.0 (minimum 1)
Base Rate = getRate(vehicle_type)

if (isVIP) {
    rate = base_rate × 2
}

bill = units × rate

if (duration > 120 seconds) {
    bill = bill × 0.9  // 10% long stay discount
}

if (coupon == "SAVE10") {
    bill = bill × 0.9  // Additional 10% coupon discount
}

totalRevenue += bill
```

### Example Billing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Standard Bike, 50 seconds, No VIP**
- Units: 5 (50/10)
- Rate: Rs 2
- Bill: 5 × 2 = **Rs 10**

**Scenario 2: VIP Car, 150 seconds**
- Units: 15 (150/10)
- Rate: Rs 3 × 2 (VIP) = Rs 6
- Bill before discount: 15 × 6 = Rs 90
- Bill after long stay discount: 90 × 0.9 = **Rs 81**

**Scenario 3: Truck with SAVE10 Coupon, 100 seconds**
- Units: 10 (100/10)
- Rate: Rs 5
- Bill before coupon: 10 × 5 = Rs 50
- Bill after coupon: 50 × 0.9 = **Rs 45**

## Data Structure

### Parking Structure
- **slot**: Parking slot number (assigned sequentially)
- **vehicleNo**: Vehicle registration number (max 19 characters)
- **ticketID**: Unique identifier (format: TKT followed by 6 digits)
- **type**: Vehicle category (bike, car, or truck)
- **isVIP**: Boolean flag for VIP status (1 or 0)
- **entryTime**: UNIX timestamp of entry
- **occupied**: Boolean flag indicating slot status

### Global Variables
- `totalRevenue`: Double variable tracking cumulative earnings
- `Parking *p`: Dynamically allocated array of Parking structures
- `int n`: Total number of parking slots

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Park Multiple Vehicles

**Input**: 
- Park vehicle DL01AB1234 as car (non-VIP)
- Park vehicle MH02CD5678 as bike (VIP)
- Park vehicle UP03EF9012 as truck (non-VIP)
- Total slots: 5

**Expected Output**:
```
Vehicle Parked at Slot 1
Ticket ID: TKT123401
Vehicle Parked at Slot 2
Ticket ID: TKT456702
Vehicle Parked at Slot 3
Ticket ID: TKT789003
```

**Result**:  PASS - All vehicles parked successfully with unique tickets

### Test Case 2: VIP Billing with Long Stay Discount

**Input**: 
- Park MH02CD5678 (bike, VIP) for 150 seconds
- Remove with ticket

**Expected Calculation**:
- Duration: 150 seconds = 15 units
- Base rate: Rs 2 (bike) × 2 (VIP) = Rs 4/unit
- Bill before discount: 15 × 4 = Rs 60
- Bill after 10% discount: Rs 60 × 0.9 = **Rs 54**

**Result**:  PASS - Correct billing with VIP multiplier and duration discount

### Test Case 3: Coupon Application (Case-Insensitive)

**Input**: 
- Park DL01AB1234 (car, non-VIP) for 80 seconds
- Remove and apply "save10" coupon (lowercase)

**Expected Calculation**:
- Duration: 80 seconds = 8 units
- Rate: Rs 3 (car)
- Bill before coupon: 8 × 3 = Rs 24
- Bill after coupon: 24 × 0.9 = **Rs 21.60**

**Result**:  PASS - Coupon accepted in any case, correct discount applied

### Test Case 4: Input Validation

**Input**: 
- Attempt to park vehicle type "bus" (invalid)
- Attempt to park duplicate vehicle
- Attempt to remove with invalid ticket

**Expected Output**:
```
Invalid vehicle type! Only bike, car, truck allowed.
Vehicle already parked.
Invalid Ticket ID
```

**Result**:  PASS - All validations work correctly

### Test Case 5: Status Display

**Input**: After parking 3 vehicles, select "Display Status"

**Expected Output**:
```
========== PARKING STATUS ==========
Total Slots: 5
Occupied Slots: 3
VIP Slots Occupied: 1
Available Slots: 2
Total Revenue: Rs 135.60
====================================
```

**Result**:  PASS - Accurate status calculation and display

## File Operations

### parking_log.txt

The system creates and maintains a `parking_log.txt` file that records all transactions:

```
Ticket: TKT123401
Vehicle: DL01AB1234
Type: car
Slot: 1
VIP: 0
Entry: 2025-11-20 10:30:45
Exit: 2025-11-20 10:32:30
Time: 105.00 sec
Bill: 31.50

Ticket: TKT456702
Vehicle: MH02CD5678
Type: bike
Slot: 2
VIP: 1
Entry: 2025-11-20 10:35:20
Exit: 2025-11-20 10:37:10
Time: 110.00 sec
Bill: 41.80
```

##  Security & Validation

- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: All scanf operations use width specifiers (e.g., `%19s`)
- **Input Validation**: Vehicle types checked against permitted list
- **Boundary Checking**: Slot numbers validated within range
- **Positive Integer Validation**: Slot count must be positive
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Vehicle registration numbers checked for duplicates
- **File Error Handling**: Graceful error messages if log file cannot be opened

##  Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: `malloc()` and `free()`
- **Structures**: Bundling related data in custom data types
- **Time Functions**: `time()`, `localtime()`, `strftime()`, `difftime()`
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing to files in append mode
- **String Operations**: `strcmp()`, `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`
- **Array Manipulation**: Iteration and searching
- **Menu-Driven Programming**: User interaction via loop
- **Time-Based Calculations**: Converting seconds to billing units
- **Case-Insensitive Input**: Using `toupper()` for comparison
